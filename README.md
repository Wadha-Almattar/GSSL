## Datasets

### Pretraining Dataset
#### Optic Disc Macula dataset (ODM) (link)
We created a novel dataset by combining two datasets DRTiD and DeepDRiD with dual-view fundus images. Our dataset, ODM, which stands for Optic-disc and Macula-centered, is designed explicitly for self-supervised learning and differs from the original dataset used for supervised learning. In contrast, combining datasets from different sources acquired from various sites can enrich diverse data structures and representations, which is the basis of learning in SSL. This fusion of diverse data can provide a more comprehensive knowledge to the SSL model. Furthermore, it is crucial to provide SSL models with varying difficulty levels of samples, where easy examples can guide the modelâ€™s initial learning, while harder ones can push its boundaries and enhance representation learning.
Our constructed ODM dataset comprises 5100 pairs of two-field fundus images, each representing a specific grade. The ODM dataset exhibits imbalances, similar to the original dataset and many benchmark datasets in supervised learning. The development of this extensive dataset and its variations addresses a significant gap in the study community and drives future progress in dual-views diabetic retinopathy diagnosis research using the self-supervised learning paradigm. The fundus images in Figure 1 display several DR samples from the ODM dataset.

#### ODM dataset variants
We create four versions of Optic-disc (OD), Macula (MA), Optic-disc and Macula Small ODM-S, and Optic-disc and Macula Green ODM-G, Table 1 describes briefly each variant. The OD dataset comprises 2545 single- view fundus images obtained with the optic disc (OD) posi- tioned at the center. A new perspective was created using the MA dataset, which consists of 2544 fundus images collected with a focus on the macula. ODM-S is a subset of the original ODM dual-view dataset with the same amount of samples as the OD and MA datasets. It differs from OD and MA datasets in that the ODM-S specifically focuses on examples of dual views. The last variant, ODM-G, includes dual-view fundus images that solely contain the green channel while maintaining the same number of samples as ODM.
